# LearningML

This is my attempt to (finally!) do some hands-on learning about machine learning.
I've learned a bit about the basic theory of ML but I've never tried it myself.

This repo will be mostly copy-pasted code from the TensorFlow Keras [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).
